Feel free to use this code for whatever you'd like.
Under no circumstances do I require credit.
Credit is nice, but not necessary.
Knowing that any license terms I put on this code can be
Ignored, It is important
That everyone is realistic about the strength of licenses.
Despite the fact that I honor
Open source licenses, it is my own choice to 
Willingly release this.
However, you cannot hold me responsible for anything someone else does with this.
Anyone can do anything after
This is released into the
Ether.
Verifiably, commercial AI companies have stolen
Everything they want.
Resist anyway.
