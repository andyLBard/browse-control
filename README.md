#Browse control MCP
This project is meant as a jumping off point for creating custom MCP services for individual websites.
It also can be used to create a more general service that allows access to general sites that are on an
allowlist.

##Installation
This project uses python3, and a venv is recommended.

##Usage
To use this project, start the server by running the command
`python3 bc_mcp.py #(or bc_wiki_mcp.py, or any new server script)`
The output will include the service ip and port. Be sure to include /mcp at the end of the URL when configuring
your agent/model runner.
